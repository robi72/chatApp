Samer and Robert based on socket.io technology.

## For installing and runing the app:

1- First of all you need to install dependences by: npm i.

## Note:

In the Terminal you will get server running message and you will be able to see how many connection do you have on the port.

When you enter name in the field and login you would be see that you have 1 connection in the terminal, so you need to open another page on the same port and enter a new name to start chatting between those those two users,
